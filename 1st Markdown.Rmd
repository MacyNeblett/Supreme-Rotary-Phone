## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
numericInput("n","How many cars?",5)

renderTable({head(cars, input$n)})

```

- Stuff
- More stuff

equation block:
$$E = mc^{2}$$
```{r results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(data,caption = "Table with kable")
```





## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
